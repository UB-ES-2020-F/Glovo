    'In September 2020 we, a group of students from the University of Barcelona (UB), were given the mission to mimic the webpage of the delivery company Glovo. Glovo is a Catalan startup founded in Barcelona in 2015, and its main goal is to deliver to the customer "anything that can fit in their box", as they say.\n\nAfter many meetings and a lot of thinking, we came up with our own name, Komet, and ideas on how to implement all the functionalities this company offers. We decided to develop the frontend part of the webpage using Flutter, an open-source software development kit created by Google which is written in Dart language. Although Flutter is widely known for the development of Android and iOS apps, its web section is in the beta version, and despite some minor bugs or still unsupported services, we agreed on using Flutter 1.23.0-18.1.pre, channel beta, for the frontend of our project. When required, the frontend calls an API we built using .NET core 3.1.403, that manages the database and all the functionalities that require some logic beyond the display of information. To ensure that our project was robust and reliable, we used both Travis and SonarQube to test the different approaches we implemented, in both the frontend and the backend.\n\nAll in all, we managed to deploy the current version of the application after four 2-week sprints, using agile methodologies (both Scrum and Kanban). The last version of the application was deployed on Tuesday, 15th of December 2020.';
